# BetterBox Server

## Getting Started & Installation

```
$ npm install
```

Before running the server locally, you'll need to create a local `.env` file in the project's root directory.
Look at `.env.example` to see what keys to include.

To run the server on your local machine, run this command in your shell from the project root directory

```
$ npm start
```

To run the server in debug mode (showing all logger messages in the terminal), run this command in your shell

```
$ npm run debug
```
